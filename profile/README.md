## Perl Bitcoin Toolchain Collective

This is an organization focused on developing native Perl tools useful for Bitcoin-specific tasks. Feel free to ask questions or provide feedback in the GitHub discussions.

If you'd like to join, please [open an issue in the `.github` repository](https://github.com/Perl-Bitcoin/.github/issues/new).
As a member, you can help by reviewing the organization's modules and their documentation, which requires a basic knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol and asymmetric cryptography. Ideally, members would develop enough expertise and interest over time to become contributors. It's all voluntary - we're happy to have you even if you're just interested in the development of the toolchain.
